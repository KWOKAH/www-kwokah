        <p>Our Privacy Policy appears on our website and we will also provide a copy of our current Privacy Policy to anyone who makes a request, free of charge.</p>
        <h3>Consent</h3>
        <p>By using this website or ordering any products from Knobby, you will be deemed to have consented to KWOKAH handling your data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>
        <h3>What is personal information?</h3>
        <p>Under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) personal information is defined to mean information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information or opinion is true or not, and whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.</p>
        <p>Personal information can include sensitive information. Sensitive information is defined as information or an opinion about a person’s race, ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of political associations and trade associations, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual orientation or practices, criminal record, health information, genetic information about an individual that is not otherwise health information, biometric information that is used for the purpose of automated biometric verification or biometric identification and biometric templates.</p>
        <h3>Personal information that we collect and hold</h3>
        <p>KWOKAH collects, holds and uses personal information in order to provide and improve its products and services.

        <p>We generally collect personal information in the following ways:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>information that you give to us (for example through our website, via email or via telephone);</li>
          <li>information we receive from third party service providers, for example our payment gateway service provider;</li>
          <li>publicly available sources;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The types of personal information that we can collect and hold include:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>name;</li>
          <li>contact details including address, email address and telephone number;</li>
          <li>order information including details of all products purchased;</li>
          <li>information from third party services to enable KWOKAH to monitor and analyse web-traffic and can be used to keep track of website user behaviour.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cookies and Tracking Technologies</h3>
        <p>KWOKAH does not use cookies or other tracking technologies to collect or store personal information from visitors to our website.</p>
        <h3>Disclosure of your personal information</h3>
        <p>KWOKAH never sells any personal information.</p>
        <p>KWOKAH may disclose your personal information to:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>our related entities and associates;</li>
          <li>personnel involved with the operation of this website including administration, sales, marketing and system administration.</li>
          <li>lawyers and other professional advisers;</li>
          <li>our service providers and contractors including mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies and communications agencies;</li>
          <li>our agents, associates and business partners;</li>
          <li>any entity to which we are required or authorised by or under law to disclose such information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Marketing and advertising</h3>
        <p>KWOKAH will never use or disclose any sensitive information for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>
        <p>We may use and disclose your personal information (other than sensitive information) to provide you with information about products or services offered by KWOKAH or other companies or entities.</p>
        <p>If at any time you do not wish to receive marketing emails from us or you do not want your personal information disclosed for marketing purposes, please contact our Privacy Officer and we will remove your details from our marketing database.</p>
        <h3>Data Integrity</h3>
        <p>KWOKAH endeavours to ensure that all personal information that it holds is accurate, complete and up-to-date. To assist us with this, individuals should contact us if any of their personal information changes, or if they believe that the personal information we have is not accurate or complete.</p>
        <p>When personal information that we collect is no longer required by KWOKAH, we will destroy or de-identify that personal information unless we are required by law or a court/tribunal to retain the personal information.</p>
        <p>We may retain personal information for so long as it is required for any of our business purposes, for the prevention of fraud, for insurance and governance purposes and in our IT back-up.</p>
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>While we will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information that we hold from misuse, loss, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure, you should be aware that no system is completely secure against cyber attack.</p>
        <p>In addition, the open nature of the internet is such that information exchanged via the internet may be accessed and used by people other than those for whom the data is intended. Any information sent via the internet is sent at the sender’s risk.</p>
        <p>You should contact us immediately if you believe that there has been unauthorised access or disclosure with respect to any personal information that we hold about you.</p>
        <h3>Disclosure Overseas</h3>
        <p>KWOKAH is unlikely to disclose your personal information overseas to persons other than technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communication agencies and manufacturers, however if we do so, it will be in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.</p>
        <h3>De-identified data</h3>
        <p>You consent to KWOKAH using and disclosing your de-identified data (data that no longer identifies you) for any purpose, including without limitation research, statistical analysis, product development, marketing and business planning and any other commercial purpose. We undertake technical measures to make sure that this data cannot be associated back to you.</p>
        <h3>Government related identifiers</h3>
        <p>KWOKAH does not use any government-related identifiers, such as driver’s licence or passport numbers, as its own internal identifier of any individual. KWOKAH will not use or disclose any government-related identifiers other than in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth).</p>
        <h3>Access and correction</h3>
        <p>Individuals can request access to their personal information held by KWOKAH by sending a written request to our Privacy Officer.</p>
        <p>KWOKAH does not impose a charge for making a request for access, however we may charge for reasonable administrative costs incurred in providing access.</p>
        <p>You can ask our Privacy Officer to request or update your personal information. KWOKAH does not impose any charge with respect to requests for correction or updates.</p>
        <p>Before providing access to personal information, or correcting or updating personal information, Knobby will require your identity to be confirmed.</p>
        <p>Requests for access or correction may be refused upon the grounds contained in the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). If we refuse to provide access, or to correct or update personal information, KWOKAH will provide you with reasons for the refusal. If we refuse to correct your personal information you have the right to associate with the information a statement that the information is inaccurate, out-of-date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading. We will take such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to associate that statement with all records we hold that contain the relevant information.</p>
